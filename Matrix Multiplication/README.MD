This algorithm multiples two matrices using the Strassen method alongside normal matrix multiplication

Create file of matrices according to parameters below:

The first line should contain the order of the matrix, then follow this by the first matrix, 
in row major order, reading a row at a time, then the second matrix. Then put a blank line, 
then the order of the next multiplication and so on.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

3
2 4 1
5 6 7
2 3 6
2 4 1
1 1 1
4 5 7
